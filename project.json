Grease the inner surface of the mold with butter. Transfer the dough into the pan and press it firmly to the bottom and up the sides to form a sandy base for the future cheesecake. Preheat the oven to 160°C and bake the base for 15-20 minutes. Next, remove the pan from the oven and let cool completely. Prepare the cheesecake filling: Using a stand mixer or blender, beat the cream cheese on medium speed until fluffy. Gradually add sugar, a pinch of salt, flour, lemon zest and juice, continuing to beat until fluffy, about 2-3 minutes. In a separate container, beat eggs and cream. Pour the egg mixture into the cream cheese and gently stir until smooth. Take the baked cheesecake base in a springform pan and pour the batter over the crust. Preheat the oven to 160°C and bake for 60 minutes."
